Success Metrics

1. Complex Request Success Rate: >85% for multi-step requests
2. User Confirmation Reduction: 50% fewer approval prompts
3. Code Quality: Generated/modified code passes validation >95%
4. Recovery Success: 100% successful rollback on errors
5. User Satisfaction: "Handles complex requests well" >4.5/5

Conclusion

The current codebase has strong foundational components but lacks the integration layer to handle
complex requests end-to-end. By implementing the proposed Request Orchestrator, Enhanced Code
Analysis, Multi-File Refactoring, and Resilient Execution frameworks, ollama-code will transform from
 a command-based tool into an intelligent development assistant capable of understanding and
executing sophisticated code tasks with minimal user intervention.

The key is connecting existing advanced components (intent analysis, task planning, autonomous
modification) into cohesive workflows with robust error handling, context awareness, and intelligent
validationâ€”creating a system that truly understands code and can reliably modify it at scale.
