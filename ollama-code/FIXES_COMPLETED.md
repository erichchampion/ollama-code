## üîí Security Fixes

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Cryptographic Implementation
**File:** `src/ai/providers/provider-manager.ts` (lines 157-223)

**Issue:** Used non-existent Node.js crypto APIs (`createCipherGCM`, `createDecipherGCM`)

**Fix:**
- Replaced with correct `createCipheriv` and `createDecipheriv` APIs
- Added algorithm validation with whitelist (`aes-256-gcm`, `aes-192-gcm`, `aes-128-gcm`)
- Added proper error handling for encryption/decryption failures
- Added 12-byte IV generation for GCM mode

**Impact:** Critical security vulnerability fixed - encryption now works correctly

## üéØ Type Safety Improvements

### 2. ‚úÖ Replaced 'any' Types with Proper TypeScript Types
**Files:**
- `src/types/app-interfaces.ts` (new file)
- `src/index.ts`
- `src/core/container.ts`
- `src/config/index.ts`
- `src/terminal/index.ts`
- `src/commands/index.ts`

**Issue:** Extensive use of `any` types reducing type safety

**Fix:**
- Created comprehensive type definitions in `src/types/app-interfaces.ts`
- Defined interfaces: `AppConfig`, `AIClient`, `CodebaseAnalysis`, `CommandProcessor`, `FileOperations`, `ExecutionEnvironment`, `ErrorHandler`, `Telemetry`
- Updated core files to use proper typed interfaces
- Changed `any` to `unknown` in generic contexts
- Added proper type guards and assertions

**Impact:** Significantly improved type safety and IDE autocomplete support

## üíæ Memory Leak Fixes

### 3. ‚úÖ Fixed Memory Leak in Provider Manager Health Monitoring
**File:** `src/ai/providers/provider-manager.ts` (lines 520-532, 714-720)

**Issue:** Health check interval could be created multiple times without clearing previous ones

**Fix:**
- Added check to clear existing interval before creating new one in `startHealthMonitoring()`
- Removed redundant interval clearing in `dispose()`
- Added debug logging for health monitoring lifecycle

**Impact:** Prevents interval accumulation and memory leaks

### 4. ‚úÖ Fixed Timer Cleanup in Tool Orchestrator
**File:** `src/tools/orchestrator.ts` (lines 258-292)

**Issue:** Missing proper cleanup for cache timers and event listeners

**Fix:**
- Enhanced `cancelAll()` method with debug logging
- Added new `dispose()` method for complete cleanup
- Clears all timers, cache, and event listeners
- Removes all EventEmitter listeners

**Impact:** Proper resource cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 5. ‚úÖ Implemented Proper Timeout Cleanup
**File:** `src/interactive/enhanced-mode.ts` (lines 281-309)

**Issue:** Race condition - timeout not cleared after Promise.race resolves

**Fix:**
- Added timeout ID tracking
- Clear timeout immediately after race resolves
- Added finally block to ensure cleanup even on errors
- Proper error handling for timeout scenarios

**Impact:** Prevents timeout accumulation and memory leaks

### 6. ‚úÖ Added Maximum History Size Enforcement
**File:** `src/ai/conversation-manager.ts` (lines 419-439)

**Issue:** Conversation history could grow unbounded

**Fix:**
- Enhanced `trimHistory()` method with sliding window implementation
- Added detailed debug logging for trim operations
- Properly enforces `maxHistorySize` limit (keeps most recent N entries)
- Logs previous size, new size, and removed count

**Impact:** Prevents unbounded memory growth in long-running sessions

### 10. ‚úÖ Fixed Tool Result Cache Eviction Strategy
**File:** `src/tools/streaming-orchestrator.ts` (lines 814-846)

**Issue:** Used FIFO (First-In-First-Out) instead of LRU (Least Recently Used)

**Fix:**
- Changed from evicting first entry to finding least recently used entry
- Iterates through all entries to find oldest timestamp
- Added detailed debug logging for LRU evictions
- Logs evicted entry ID and age

**Impact:** More efficient cache utilization - keeps frequently accessed results

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### 7. ‚úÖ Fixed Buffer Truncation in ollama-client.ts
**File:** `src/ai/ollama-client.ts` (lines 602-618)

**Issue:** Buffer truncated at arbitrary byte position, potentially cutting JSON objects

**Fix:**
- Truncate at newline boundaries (JSON object boundaries) instead
- Keep last 50% of lines when buffer exceeds 1MB
- Added debug logging with original/new size and lines removed
- Ensures JSON objects are not corrupted

**Impact:** Prevents JSON parsing errors from corrupted data

### 8. ‚úÖ Added File Locking for Concurrent Saves
**File:** `src/ai/providers/provider-manager.ts` (lines 97, 594-628, 633-654)

**Issue:** Concurrent writes could corrupt configuration/credentials files

**Fix:**
- Added `saveLock` object with separate locks for config and credentials
- Implemented mutex-like mechanism with polling
- Wait with 50ms delay if another save is in progress
- Added debug logging for successful saves
- Finally block ensures lock is always released

**Impact:** Prevents file corruption from concurrent writes

### 9. ‚úÖ Implemented Deadlock Detection with Topological Sort
**File:** `src/tools/orchestrator.ts` (lines 190-257)

**Issue:** Basic deadlock detection - couldn't identify circular dependencies

**Fix:**
- Added `detectCircularDependencies()` method using DFS algorithm
- Maintains visited set and recursion stack
- Tracks path to build circular dependency chain
- Throws detailed error with circular chain on detection
- Uses topological sort approach for dependency validation

**Impact:** Better error messages and early detection of configuration errors

### 11. ‚úÖ Added Approval Timeout in Streaming Orchestrator
**File:** `src/tools/streaming-orchestrator.ts` (lines 697-745)

**Issue:** Approval prompts could hang indefinitely

**Fix:**
- Added 60-second timeout for approval prompts
- Wrapped prompt in Promise.race with timeout
- Proper timeout cleanup with finally block
- Enhanced error message with timeout details
- Caches approval decision after successful prompt

**Impact:** Prevents hanging on user input, better UX

### 12. ‚úÖ Added Error Handling for MCP Client Initialization
**File:** `src/core/services.ts` (lines 75-114)

**Issue:** MCP client initialization failures could crash the application

**Fix:**
- Wrapped initialization in try-catch block
- Added 30-second timeout for initialization
- Returns stub client on failure to prevent cascade failures
- Stub implements basic interface (initialize, dispose, isConnected)
- Comprehensive error logging

**Impact:** Application continues running even if MCP client fails

### 13. ‚úÖ Implemented Retry Mechanism for Persistence Directory Creation
**File:** `src/ai/conversation-manager.ts` (lines 552-580)

**Issue:** Single-attempt directory creation could fail on transient errors

**Fix:**
- Added retry mechanism with 3 attempts
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s delays)
- Logs each attempt with warning level
- Throws descriptive error after all retries exhausted
- Success logging with attempt number

**Impact:** More resilient against transient filesystem issues

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

### 14. ‚úÖ Added IDisposable Interface and Enforcement
**File:** `src/core/container.ts` (lines 20-26, 198-232)

**Issue:** No standardized disposal interface for services

**Fix:**
- Created `IDisposable` interface with dispose method signature
- Updated container `dispose()` to use IDisposable
- Added type guard `isDisposable()` for safe checking
- Dispose services in reverse order of registration
- Enhanced error handling and logging

**Impact:** Standardized cleanup pattern across all services
