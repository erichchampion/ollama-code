## Bug Fix Protocol

Throughout test development, bugs will be discovered. Follow this protocol:

### 1. Bug Discovery and Documentation
When a test fails due to a bug (not a test issue):
- [ ] Create GitHub issue with label `bug-from-testing`
- [ ] Document expected vs. actual behavior
- [ ] Attach test case that reproduces the bug
- [ ] Assign severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- [ ] Link to relevant test file and line number

### 2. Bug Triage
- **Critical bugs** (crashes, data loss, security): Fix immediately, delay test development
- **High bugs** (feature not working): Fix within 1 week, continue other tests
- **Medium bugs** (degraded UX, edge cases): Fix within 2 weeks, continue all tests
- **Low bugs** (cosmetic issues): Add to backlog, continue tests

### 3. Bug Fix Workflow
- [ ] Create feature branch: `bugfix/ISSUE-123-description`
- [ ] Write regression test to reproduce bug
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Verify regression test now passes
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Submit PR with issue reference in title

### 4. Common Bug Categories to Watch For

#### Authentication & Security Bugs
- Missing input validation (path traversal, injection)
- Weak authentication checks
- Exposed secrets or API keys
- CORS misconfigurations

#### Performance Bugs
- Memory leaks (event listeners not removed)
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) or worse)
- Unbounded caching
- File handle leaks

#### IDE Integration Bugs
- Provider registration timing issues
- WebSocket connection race conditions
- Message ordering problems
- Extension activation failures

#### File Operation Bugs
- File locking issues (concurrent edits)
- Permission errors not handled
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Backup/rollback failures

#### AI Integration Bugs
- Prompt injection vulnerabilities
- Malformed response handling
- Timeout issues with slow models
- Token limit exceeded errors

## Testing Best Practices

### Test Organization
```
tests/
├── e2e/                    # End-to-end tests
│   ├── cli/               # CLI command E2E tests

│   └── security/         # Security scanning integration
├── unit/                 # Unit tests (existing)
└── fixtures/             # Test data fixtures
    ├── projects/         # Sample codebases

    ├── vulnerable/      # Code with security issues
    └── ai-responses/    # Captured AI responses
```

### Test Naming Conventions
- **E2E tests:** `feature-scenario.e2e.test.ts`
  - Example: `create-file-with-ai.e2e.test.ts`
- **Integration tests:** `component-integration.test.ts`
  - Example: `websocket-mcp-integration.test.ts`
- **Unit tests:** `component.test.ts` (existing pattern)

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Feature: Create File Command', () => {
  describe('Scenario: Basic file creation', () => {
    it('should create file with AI-generated content', async () => {
      // Arrange: Set up test environment
      const testDir = await createTestDirectory();

      // Act: Execute the command
      const result = await executeCommand(
        'create-file src/Button.tsx --description "React button"'
      );

      // Assert: Verify outcomes
      expect(result.exitCode).toBe(0);
      expect(fs.existsSync(path.join(testDir, 'src/Button.tsx'))).toBe(true);

      // Cleanup
      await cleanupTestDirectory(testDir);
    });
  });
});
```

### Assertions Best Practices
- **Use specific assertions:** Prefer `toBe(0)` over `toBeTruthy()`
- **Test multiple aspects:** Verify exit code, file content, logs
- **Use snapshots for complex output:** AI-generated code, formatted reports
- **Add helpful messages:** `expect(result).toBe(0, 'Command should succeed')`

### Flakiness Prevention
- **Avoid timing dependencies:** Use `waitFor()` instead of fixed delays
- **Isolate tests:** Each test should clean up after itself
- **Mock external services:** Don't rely on real API calls for unit/integration tests
- **Use deterministic data:** Avoid random data in tests
- **Retry flaky E2E tests:** Configure 2-3 retries for E2E tests only

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Suite

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  unit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

## Risk Management

### High Risks
1. **AI Model Availability**
   - Risk: Ollama or other AI providers unavailable during testing
   - Mitigation: Use cached responses, implement mock fallbacks
   - Contingency: Delay AI-dependent tests, continue non-AI tests

2. **VS Code API Changes**
   - Risk: VS Code updates break extension tests
   - Mitigation: Pin VS Code version for testing, monitor release notes
   - Contingency: Update tests to match new API within 1 week

3. **Test Flakiness**
   - Risk: E2E tests become unreliable due to timing issues
   - Mitigation: Implement robust wait strategies, retry logic
   - Contingency: Quarantine flaky tests, investigate root cause

### Medium Risks
4. **Test Data Maintenance**
   - Risk: Test fixtures become outdated
   - Mitigation: Automated fixture generation, regular updates
   - Contingency: Regenerate fixtures as needed

5. **CI/CD Performance**
   - Risk: Test suite becomes too slow for CI/CD
   - Mitigation: Parallel execution, test sharding
   - Contingency: Run E2E tests nightly instead of per-commit

### Low Risks
6. **Team Skill Gaps**
   - Risk: Team lacks E2E testing expertise
   - Mitigation: Training sessions, pair programming
   - Contingency: Hire contractor for initial setup
