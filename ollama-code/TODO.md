## Development Workflow

### For Each Feature:

1. **Write Tests First**
   ```bash
   # Create test file
   touch tests/unit/component/new-feature.test.ts

   # Write failing tests
   yarn test tests/unit/component/new-feature.test.ts
   # Tests should fail - no implementation yet
   ```

2. **Implement Feature**
   ```bash
   # Create implementation
   touch src/component/new-feature.ts

   # Implement until tests pass
   yarn test tests/unit/component/new-feature.test.ts --watch
   ```

3. **Refactor**
   ```bash
   # Clean up code while keeping tests green
   yarn test tests/unit/component/new-feature.test.ts
   ```

4. **Integration Test**
   ```bash
   # Add integration tests
   touch tests/integration/component/new-feature-integration.test.ts
   yarn test:integration
   ```

5. **Validate Success Metrics**
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   yarn test:all

   # Check coverage
   yarn test --coverage
   ```

---

## Notes

- All existing functionality must continue to work (regression testing)
- Maintain backward compatibility with current CLI interface
- Follow existing code style and patterns where possible
- Prioritize user safety (rollback, validation, confirmation)
- Keep AI provider abstraction (support Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Respect user privacy (no telemetry without opt-in)
