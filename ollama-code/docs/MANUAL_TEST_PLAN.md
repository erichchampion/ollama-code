# Manual Test Plan - Ollama Code CLI v0.1.0
*Comprehensive Testing for Three-Phase AI-Powered Development Assistant*

## Overview
This manual test plan validates the enhanced query processing architecture implementation:
- **Phase 1:** Enhanced Intent Analysis with Timeout Protection ✅
- **Phase 2:** Multi-Step Query Processing with Context Management ✅
- **Phase 3:** Advanced Context Management (Planned)
- **Phase 4:** Query Decomposition Engine (Planned)
- **Phase 5:** Knowledge Graph Integration (Planned)

The system provides intelligent query processing with session management, follow-up detection, context awareness, and progressive disclosure for complex interactions.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Ollama server installed and running (`ollama serve`)
- At least one Ollama model available (e.g., `llama3.2`, `codellama`)
- Project built successfully (`npm run build`)
- CLI executable permissions set (`chmod +x dist/src/cli-selector.js`)
- Git repository for testing git-related features

## Test Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Verify Ollama server is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# 2. Ensure at least one model is available
ollama list

# 3. If no models, pull one for testing
ollama pull llama3.2

# 4. Build the project and verify compilation
npm run build
npm test

# 5. Test basic CLI accessibility
./dist/src/cli-selector.js --version

# 6. Set up test project environment
mkdir test-project && cd test-project
git init
echo "console.log('Hello World');" > index.js
echo "export function add(a, b) { return a + b; }" > math.js
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## Quick Reference: Phase 2 Testing Commands

### Interactive Mode Session Testing
```bash
# Start interactive mode
./dist/src/cli-selector.js interactive

# Test multi-step query processing (in interactive mode)
analyze this codebase structure
what about the test files?
explain more about the structure

# Session management commands
/session          # View current session details
/end-session      # End current session
/help             # View updated help with session commands
```

### Follow-Up Detection Test Patterns
```bash
# Follow-up patterns that should be detected:
"what about..."
"can you also..."
"explain more..."
"tell me more..."
"show me the..."

# Independent queries (should not be follow-ups):
"create a component"
"run the tests"
"list files"
```
